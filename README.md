# .nixconfig - my dotfiles

These are my configuration files used on my Linux and MacOS environments.

## Directory structure

|||
|-|-|
|/|Contains all dotfiles and the bootstraping init script. Contrary to other dotfiles projects, the config files for all the different systems live in one and the same space.|
|backupscripts|Contains different scripts to automate the file system backup with rdiff-backups.|
|environmentscripts|Scripts that get called automatically (mostly on startup). Not included in PATH.|
|userscripts|Custom shell scripts from me (the user). Included in PATH.|
|sshscripts|Personal and sensitive scripts that initiate a ssh session. Included in PATH, but excluded by the `.gitignore`.|
|vim|Config files for vim. Swap, undo and backup files generated by vim will be temporarily stored within the corresponding subfolders (also ignored by `.gitignore`).|
|zshthemes|My custom oh-my-zsh-themes, which will be copied to the right place by the init script.|
|manuals|Manuals I created for personal use.|
|.fonts|Fonts I have copied from somewhere that will be used by the terminal and gvim.|


## Bootstraping init script
I've written a simple script `installlinks.sh`, which symlinks every config file. Existing files will be backuped by appending `_bak` to the end of the filename.
Although it shouldn't destroy something permamentely, please use this script with caution, since it may be a little problematic in special cases.

### Installation

1. checkout repository to `~/.nixconfig`
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gaeburider/nixconfig.git .nixconfig
    ```
2. install symlinks:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/.nixconfig/installlinks.sh
    ~/.nixconfig/installlinks.sh
    ```
3. (optional) add private ssh files (e.g private keys) to `~/.nixconfig/.ssh`
